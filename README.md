# InverseHullWeb
Create Inverse Hull Webs of thermodynamic materials systems. Please cite the following paper:

Evans, D., Chen, J., Bokas, G. _et al._ Visualizing temperature-dependent phase stability in high entropy alloys. _npj Comput Mater_ __7__, 151 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00626-1

## Description
This repository contains code to create _Inverse Hull Webs_, displaying energetic phase stability relationships in materials systems. The code is structured after the _PhaseDiagram_ class in [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen), where there is an _InverseHullWebEntry_ class containing information about each phase in the Inverse Hull Web and an _InverseHullWeb_ class that creates the diagrams.

Additionally, there is a tutorial to create these Inverse Hull Webs for High-Entropy Alloy systems. This can be found in the _IHW_tutorial.ipynb_ jupyter notebook.
